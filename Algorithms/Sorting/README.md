# Sorting algorithms

## Definition:
Sorting algorihtms - 

## Bubble sorting:
Bubble sort - is most common sort algorithms that have O(n^2) complexity

## Selection sorting:
Selection sort - is also common sort when you choose the smallest element in array. Also O(n^2) complexity

## Merge sorting:
Merge sort - is faster sorting algorithm than previous, it based on recursion

## Quick sorting:
Quick sort - is one of the msot fastest sort algorithms, because most situaion is happened more often. Also recursion based algorithm
