# Sorting algorithms

## Definition:
Sorting algorihtms - 

## Bubble sorting:
Bubble sort - is most common sort algorithms that have O(n^2) complexity

## Selection sorting:
Selection sort - is also common sort when you choose the smallest element in array. Also O(n^2) complexity

## Merge sorting:
Merge sort - is faster sorting algorithm than previous, it based on recursion

## Quick sorting:
Quick sort - is one of the msot fastest sort algorithms, because most situaion is happened more often. Also recursion based algorithm

## Bucket sort:
Bucket sort - is special sort that can help in some problem with prefix sums or something like that. Also recursion based algorithm, and in some case work in O(n), but worse case is slower than Quick sort
